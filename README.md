===========

Energy Monitoring Dashboard with youless API support



## TODO

* provide local storage config in frontend
* make youless optional (on by default though)
* check in v 0.1.0 and tag it
* create controls for resolutions
* remove dash (for now)

## nice to have

* data compare in graph: http://cmaurer.github.io/angularjs-nvd3-directives/stacked.area.chart.html
