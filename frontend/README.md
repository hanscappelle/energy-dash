# About

Angular App for visualisation of youless data with d3js framework.

## Getting Started

### Run as chrome app

Import everything from the app folder as is in chrome as an unpackaged chrome app (development option).

### Run as a service with nodeJS

   npm install
   grunt
   grunt serve

## TODO

* refine build process (check grunt file)
* enable tests again
* enable jshint again

### nice to have

* add transition effects to graphs
* have items clickable for more detail
* improve code in general

## DONE

* improve rendering based on screen size (+ package for mobile) => migrate to nvd3 first
* implement several periods/scopes/resolutions for viewing data => use angular-ui-routes
* move controllers to separate files
* test graphs
* create project structure
* fix bootstrap
* get angular en d3js scripts downloaded
* complete data visualisation from youless-mockup, DONE for bar graph, DONE for gauge
* store config on local storage
* add config page for ip, port, password

## Screen layouts

Mostly based on the windows app [http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/nl-nl/app/youless/bbf786d5-6b8a-4050-9026-dff3210a401f].
Some minor tweaks though and let's not forget this js implementation can run on browsers and mobile devices.

## gauges

Found 2 minimal projects for this [https://gist.github.com/tomerd/1499279] is nice
but the gauge example at [http://bl.ocks.org/msqr/3202712] had numbers instead of ticks already in place so picked that one.
